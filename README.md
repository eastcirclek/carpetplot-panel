# Carpet plot

Carpet plot plugin for Grafana. It is different from [petraslavotinek/grafana-carpetplot](https://github.com/petrslavotinek/grafana-carpetplot) in that it groups time-series data first by time and then by a tag provided by user. 
You must group by not only time but also a tag to use this carpet plot plugin.

Note that [petraslavotinek/grafana-carpetplot](https://github.com/petrslavotinek/grafana-carpetplot) groups the data first by day and then by a selected fragment of a day (hour / 15 minutes / minute).
